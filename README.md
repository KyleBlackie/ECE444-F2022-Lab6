The test case that I wrote was a unit test for our course search endpoint called `test_course_search`. It can be found using the link below.

# What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Test driven development allows us to place a higher degree of importance on testing in the development cycle. By writing tests first, we ensure that tests are not an afterthought in the development process. This leads to greater test coverage and tests that are not hastily created meaning that our applications are more robust and less likely to suffer from bugs/errors. TDD also fits well with the Agile methodology as it is an iterative approach to creating small unit test cases followed by code necessary to make the tests pass. This works well with the iterative nature of Agile.
